# Based on AstroNvim

If you haven't installed AstroNvim, do [these](#dodo) first.



My key mappings are:

F1 : show help command

F4:  use cmake-tool build and run current file, CMakeLists.txt or run.sh required

F5:  debug by dap

F6:  dial your project in most of languages, but should include a file named 'main.xxx'(xxx is your language)

F7:  open a split screen terminal
$ <S-n> $: open terminal in new window

F8: build and run current file. Support c/cpp, java, js, Go, pyhton, lua, rust. Here I set b&r cpp by c++23

F9:  add a broken point for debug on hand

Press `space` then you will get some hint for key combinations
